I spent the last 3-ish months recruiting for a full-time software engineering job. Along the way, I received a couple offers from some great companies. I wanted to share how I prepared for the stress-ball that is recruiting, with hopes that someone else can use this guide to make the process a little less taxing on the body and soul.

### LeetCode
Far and above, [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is the best way to prepare for any coding interview. However, in the past, I lacked any rhyme or reason to my approach on LeetCode; I would just filter the question list by questions that I had not solved yet, and pick randomly from that list. However, I somewhat-consciously leaned toward problems that seemed interesting, or that I knew I could solve in a reasonable amount of time. I knew that I needed to change this, so I turned toward mock interviews. 

### Mock Interviews

To truly reflect the nature of the interview process, practice should be just as random as the interview. To best simulate this environment, I made extensive use of LeetCode's mock interview feature. Currently, they only provide mock interviews from FAANG (and similar) companies. For each company, they provide mock interviews for online assessments (OAs), phone interviews, and on-site interviews.

The questions in the mock interviews are randomly sampled from a collection of questions that are typically asked in interviews for that company. Furthermore, each question _can_ be found on LeetCode outside of the mock interview feature. However, the best part about the mocks is that _you cannot view the answer during the interview_. 

Outside of the mocks, I would sometimes get frustrated by my lack of progress on the answer, and would immediately turn to the "Solution" or "Discussion" sections on LeetCode. With the inability  to do so, I found myself really persevering and digging deep to find the special tricks to solve the given problem. More often than not, I could arrive at the solution myself, which really reinforced the material.

Even if you are not preparing for a FAANG interview, I highly suggest using mock interviews regardless as they give you an accurate sample of what kinds of questions are often asked in the more difficult interviews.

### Study Guide
After each problem that I solved, I would write a detailed solution to it in my Google Doc study guide, which now rounds out at 36 pages in size 12 font. I realized, in addition to knowing how to code the solution to a given problem, it's just as important to _be able to explain how you arrived at the answer in plain english_. So, in addition to writing the code to solve the problem in the study guide, I would write 1-2 paragraphs of english explaining how to arrive at the solution.

Preparing this study guide really reinforced my knowledge of DSA concepts, especially binary trees. I found myself more easily solving difficult problems the longer this study guide became. If you would like a copy of the study guide, please email me and I will be happy to send it over!

### Verbal Communication

I would always do my mock interviews in the mornings before heading to campus. If my roommate was still home, I would have to walk out into the living room and say "if you hear me talking out loud, I promise I'm not talking to myself" (even though, in a way, I was). During each mock interview, I would verbally communicate my solutions as if my computer were the interviewer, since this is how real interviews happen. In the actual interview, communication of your thought process matters almost as much as the solution itself. However, LeetCode practice alone (without talking out loud) cannot paint the whole picture. I cannot stress enough the importance of talking through your solutions out loud, even if it is just in an empty room.

### Behavioral Questions

For my first couple interviews, I thought that I could get by with not practicing any part of the behavioral interview process. **This is not the case**. During those interviews, I found myself stumbling over simple questions like "tell me about a time you disagreed with someone" or "tell me about the project that you are most proud of".

After that, I knew that I had to get to work. I made an excel sheet for all major projects I have done (school, work, and personal), and wrote down key aspects from each, such as

1. Leadership displayed
2. Conflicts and how they were resolved
3. Best part of the project
4. Biggest challenge of the project

Knowing these made my interview process that much smoother.

**Bonus**: make sure to have a 30-second spiel ready for the classic "tell me about yourself!" It will help to get the interview off to a good start if you really nail this answer.

### Prepare Questions for Interviewers

Companies want to know that you are invested in them, and asking them pointed questions is a great way to send that signal. I did a lot of research beforehand, and would write down non-generic questions about each company to ask during the interview. This is also a great time to ask the tough questions and find out if the interviewer _really_ enjoys working at that company.

While the interview process can be extremely stressful, it can also be extremely rewarding if done correctly. Put in the work, don't cut corners, and I promise you will find yourself with a couple of really nice looking offers when it's all over.
